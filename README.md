# Chicken-Disease-Classification--Project

**Introduction**  

Coccidiosis is a highly prevalent and economically significant parasitic disease that affects poultry worldwide, particularly chickens. Caused by protozoan parasites of the *Eimeria* genus, the disease leads to intestinal damage, reduced growth rates, and increased mortality in infected birds. 

 Early and accurate detection of coccidiosis is critical for effective management, treatment, and prevention to mitigate its impact on poultry production. Traditional diagnostic methods, such as microscopic examination of fecal samples, are labor-intensive, time-consuming, and often require specialized expertise. 

This project leverages deep learning techniques to classify fecal images from chickens as either indicative of coccidiosis infection or healthy.  

The goal of this project is to develop a robust and efficient classification model that can assist poultry farmers and veterinarians in identifying coccidiosis early. By automating the classification of fecal images, this approach has the potential to reduce diagnostic time, lower costs, and enable timely intervention, ultimately improving poultry health and productivity.
